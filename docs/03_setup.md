### TL;DR

- [Docker setup](#docker-setup)
- [GitHub Codespace setup](#github-codespace-setup)

To install the compiler, or the interpreter (with Python for example) and anything you need to work with, in your dev environment (i.e. dependencies, plugins, frameworks, servers), usually means being familiar with the operating system (OS), particularly the command-line interface (CLI), in other words: system administration.

The concept of running Python programs on a browser-based dev environment (e.g. GUI, IDE, CLI) may seem like a distant dream, but fortunately, with the current technology stack available, this is already a viable solution!

To run simple Python scripts, there are couple options out there:

- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) a fully-fledged Python environment, ready to go, for students and teachers (host, run, and code Python in the cloud).
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks to combine executable code and rich text in a single document (along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more).

However, if we need something more advanced &ndash; as well as more control over the dev enviroment itself &ndash; go on to the next sections to find out how to fire up a powerful Linux host and anything you need, with just a couple commands!
