<!-- ## ... simply, Think Python!

We will follow the book closely, the slides are only a guide. **Why this book?**

According to the Author's Preface, this book:

- keeps it short, better to read 10 pages than 50
- is careful with vocabulary, minimazing jargon when defining
- build gradually, avoiding trapdoors effect (bottom fall out)
- focus on programming (not the language's syntax only)
